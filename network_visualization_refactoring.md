# Network Visualization Refactoring

## Overview
We've extracted the PyVis network visualization code from the main application into a dedicated module to improve maintainability and organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created a New Network Visualization Module (`src/ui/network_visualization.py`)
- Created a dedicated module for all network visualization code
- Extracted PyVis network creation and configuration
- Extracted node styling and coloring logic
- Extracted edge creation and styling 
- Extracted HTML generation and JavaScript integration

### 2. Modular Design with Specific Functions
- `render_network_visualization()`: Main entry point for rendering
- `build_nodes_and_edges()`: Coordinates node and edge creation
- `add_nodes_to_network()`: Handles node creation and styling
- `add_edges_to_network()`: Handles edge creation and styling
- `enhance_network_html()`: Modifies PyVis HTML for better integration
- `add_position_data_to_html()`: Adds node positions to JavaScript
- `add_javascript_utilities()`: Adds utility scripts to the HTML

### 3. Updated Main Application (`main.py`)
- Removed all network visualization code (approximately 250 lines)
- Added a single line to call the extracted visualization module
- Simplified main application flow and readability

## Benefits
- **Improved Maintainability**: Network visualization code is isolated and easier to maintain
- **Better Code Organization**: Separation of concerns with dedicated visualization module
- **Reduced Complexity in Main App**: Main.py is now more focused on application flow
- **Enhanced Testability**: Network visualization can be tested independently
- **Easier Future Enhancements**: Changes to visualization won't affect the main application structure

## Architecture
The new flow for network visualization:

1. Main app determines canvas height through `render_canvas_toggle()`
2. Main app calls `render_network_visualization(canvas_height)`
3. Network visualization module builds the PyVis network
4. Network visualization module generates and enhances HTML
5. Network visualization module renders the final HTML with Streamlit components
