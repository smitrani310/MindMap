"""
Integration tests for state synchronization in the Mind Map application.

This module tests how the application maintains consistency between different
components through message-based state synchronization. It verifies that:
- Node operations (view, edit, delete, move, create) are properly synchronized
- State changes are propagated correctly through the message queue
- Response messages contain the expected state updates
- Multiple operations maintain state consistency
- Concurrent operations are handled safely with proper locking

The tests simulate real-world usage patterns by executing sequences of
operations and verifying the resulting state at each step.
